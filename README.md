# AWS_Capstone_Project

## **ðŸ“Œ Description**
This repository contains the Terraform scripts used to provision and manage the infrastructure for a highly available, scalable, and secure WordPress-based Learning Management System (LMS) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The scripts automate the deployment of a three-tier architecture, encompassing networking (VPC, subnets, route tables), compute (EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group), load balancing (Application Load Balancer), database (RDS MariaDB), DNS management (Route 53), and content delivery (CloudFront). The Terraform code is designed for modularity and reusability, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments of the LMS infrastructure.
A glimpse of the deployed LMS webpage can be seen in the images below, showcasing a user-friendly interface with readily accessible courses and intuitive navigation, providing a foundation for effective online learning.
