# AWS_Capstone_Project

## **üìå Description**
This repository contains the Terraform scripts used to provision and manage the infrastructure for a highly available, scalable, and secure WordPress-based Learning Management System (LMS) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The scripts automate the deployment of a three-tier architecture, encompassing networking (VPC, subnets, route tables), compute (EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group), load balancing (Application Load Balancer), database (RDS MariaDB), DNS management (Route 53), and content delivery (CloudFront). The Terraform code is designed for modularity and reusability, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments of the LMS infrastructure.

A glimpse of the deployed LMS webpage can be seen in the images below, showcasing a user-friendly interface with readily accessible courses and intuitive navigation, providing a foundation for effective online learning.

## **üéØ Project Objectives**
This project aimed to create a robust and cost-effective infrastructure for a WordPress-based Learning Management System (LMS) on AWS. The primary goals were to achieve high availability, scalability, security, and automation using Terraform, while minimizing costs through the utilization of AWS Free Tier resources where possible.

To achieve these objectives, the project focused on:

- Deploying a Highly Available WordPress LMS on AWS: Ensuring continuous availability, even during infrastructure failures.
- Achieving Scalability and Elasticity: Designing the solution to automatically adjust resources based on traffic.
- Enhancing Security Posture: Protecting the LMS and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
- Automating Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform: Using infrastructure-as-code for consistency and reproducibility.
- Minimizing Costs by Leveraging AWS Free Tier: Utilizing free tier resources where feasible and monitoring costs.

The architecture utilizes the following key AWS resources:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Provides a logically isolated network for the LMS infrastructure.
- **Public and Private Subnets:** Enable network segmentation and control access to resources.
- **Internet Gateway:** Allows communication between the VPC and the internet.
- **Route Tables:** Manage network traffic routing within the VPC.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demand.
- **EC2 Instances:** Host the WordPress application.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Target Group:** Defines the group of EC2 instances that the ALB routes traffic to.
- **RDS MariaDB:** Provides a managed database service for storing LMS data.
- **Security Groups:** Control network access to EC2 instances and the RDS database.

## **üí° Future Enhancements**
This project can be further enhanced by focusing on the following areas:

- **Containerization:** Migrate the WordPress application to AWS container management services (ECS/EKS) for improved orchestration, scalability, and resource utilization.
- **Serverless Functions:** Explore opportunities to leverage AWS Lambda for suitable components to reduce operational overhead and costs.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager for secure communication and data protection.
- **Advanced Optimization:** Investigate additional AWS services to further enhance security, optimize WordPress performance, improve availability and scalability, and streamline monitoring and troubleshooting.
